# Shep & Shep.info, my thesis.

Hello, my thesis is named Shep.

#### SLIDE

What is Shep?

Shep looks like a dog, and he is. But he's also a few thousand lines of code which create a chat bot, he's on the web, and I made him for ITP to use.

Before telling you about Shep I should introduce myself.

#### SLIDE

I'm Steve Klise and I'm mostly a programmer. But like all ITP students, that's not it.

#### SLIDE

Throughout ITP I've done a range of things that revolve around programming, the web and making games. And once or twice I've built something physical.

!!!! TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF TECH IN LIVES? MAYBE?

#### SLIDE

ITP is awesome. There are so many great classes that are all over the map.

In my time at ITP I've collected noise levels here on the floor for a week and analyzed and visualized the daily patterns in noisyness.

I've also designed a game to be played in Grand Central Station during rush hour.

#### SLIDE

ITP is also confusing.

#### SLIDE

BLANK SLIDE!!!!

#### SLIDE

ITP is also short.

Every two years ITP is an entirely new student body. A lot of knowledge falls through the gaps when one class graduates and another starts.

#### SLIDE

Who will remember everything?

The faculty and staff are always here at ITP to ask, but I think they'd get frustrated with some of the more frequently asked questions such as:

What is Clay Shirky's email address?

and

Who did I loan my Arduino to?

Really, I loaned someone my Arduino last year and I forget who it was and I think they forgot too.

#### SLIDE

Ask Shep.

Tell Shep to remember who you loaned your Arduino to.

I've made Shep to be the memory of ITP, its pet dog that can understand and speak English. And doesn't need to be taken for walks.

OK, but what is Shep?

#### SLIDE

Shep is built on Hubot.

So what is Hubot?

Hubot was created by Github to automate their work process. Github is a website for social code sharing.

Github has one office in San Francisco but 70 employees all around the U.S. and some of their employees in San Francisco don't go in to the office. Instead of an office Github's employees talk online through their own chat room. They made Hubot to automate daily tasks that arise in conversations in the chat room.

Github made Hubot's code available as open source software on their website. Hubot is a bundle of scripts that tell him how to respond to chat messages.

I've taken Hubot and changed his name and written scripts to make Hubot useful to ITP.

#### SLIDE

Why Shep?

#### SLIDE

Dogs respond to commands like "Fetch" and "sit" and "sic 'em."

Many of the commands that Shep responds to are short like commands you'd say to a dog.

#### SLIDE

And the character of the bot. Shep needs to be endearing. He needs to be fun to use but still usable. Dogs are pets but also used for policing, rescue and assistive purposes.


#### SLIDE

ITP is like herding cats. It's controlled chaos and so a sheep dog seemed like the ideal breed.

#### SLIDE

Hubot is open source, Shep is open source. Students can contribute to Shep. He can be taught more tricks.

#### SLIDE

I wish I had a dog.

#### SLIDE

So that's the WHY. What about the HOW.

#### SLIDE

Here I am, asking Shep what is the best LED.

#### SLIDE

Shep responds telling me that the RGB LED is the best and has been since April 6th.

Well, ok. I like orange leds better. I'm going to tell Shep this.

#### SLIDE

So RGB is still the better LED. When I told Shep that orange is the best LED he added to his memory that I told him this. Then he counted to see which of the LEDs he's been told about has the most supporters. And it was still the RGB LED.

#### SLIDE

Now Spike goes to Shep and tells him that orange is the best LED.

And Shep tells him yes, orange is now the best LED.

Spike needs to know where to get an orange led, so he asks Shep for a map.

And Shep responds with a link to a map with parts and supply stores near school.

#### SLIDE

Those were examples of two different people talking to Shep. How will ITP talk to Shep?

#### SLIDE

Currently we have The List.

It's an email listserv with most of ITP's students subscribing.

#### SLIDE

The List has its problems.

Flame wars

Filtering

These last are relevant to Shep. When asking Shep a question you want the answer immediately. You don't want to go back to your inbox and hit refresh until the answer appears.

Also every email to The List goes to the entire list of students. Creating sub groups is tricky.

When Github created Hubot they had a chatroom for Hubot to live in. Shep needs a chat room.

#### SLIDE

I made shep.info as an interface to talk to Shep.

#### SLIDE

Shep.info is real time.

It's built on IRC, Internet Relay Chat, which has been around since 1988. There are many IRC client programs available. But they aren't that friendly to use. And Shep is friendly so Shep.info makes chatting easy without needing to know anything about IRC.

#### SLIDE

The site works with rooms, or channels. There's the main channel, intended as a general forum. A user can create or join other channels.

You could make a channel for group members on a project, or for online discussion for a class.

#### SLIDE

Uses.

#### SLIDE

FUTURE.

#### SLIDE

Thanks
