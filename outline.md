## How to have a smaller conversation
For projects, etc.
The list is too big 2-way chat is too small, meeting in one place is hard.

## Backchannel
It's already happening, students chatting with each other during class. Sometimes constructive, sometimes destructive. tlk.io, piratepad, IRC etc.

# What now?
I'm graduating, will people use this?

## On Github, easy to write a script.

## Keep using it this summer, try to pass it off at the end.

# Thanks!
Greg for giving me the idea. Github for making Hubot. Rune Madsen, Clay Shirky, David Nolen, John Dimatos, Andrew Badr for consulting. Joe Kloc for giving Shep a face. Despina Papadapoulous & Thesis Class #5. ITP.
